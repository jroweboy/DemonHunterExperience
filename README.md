# Demon Hunter Experience

Restore the true Demon Hunter Experience with this simple addon.

## Features

* Really makes you *feel* like a Demon Hunter by playing Illidan voice lines from Heroes of the Storm
* Contains quotes for 9 different categories of actions
* Each category has multiple voice lines that can proc randomly
* The percentages for procing voice lines can be tweaked at both a group and individual level (allowing a person to turn off certain lines if they wanted)
* No UI to configure any of these percentages because the true Demon Hunter expects their addons to just work without needing to learn anything new.

All audio is played through the `Dialog` channel which will allow you to crank the volume to max without affecting your regular gameplay too much.
